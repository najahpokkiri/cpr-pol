## Major theories of voting behaviour 


- Sociological Model: Identified with the Columbia school - focuses on influence of social factors like group affiliation (**The People’s Choice; Personal Influence**).

- Psycho-social Model: Identified with the Michigan school - focuses on effect of partisanship or party identification (**The American Voter**).

- Rational Choice Model: Identified with the work by Anthony Downs (**An Economic Theory of Democracy**) and argues that voters seek to maximise the utility of their vote and parties seek to maximise electoral gains.



# How do Indians vote?

## Major theories and framework  


###  Preferences and Political accountability

- Ethnicity, caste, religion

    - In-group favoritism - Ethnic voting
  
    - Co-religiosity and voting behaviour 

- Clientelism/Patronage Politics: 

    - Quid pro quo - Political parties earn support by the distribution of public or private goods to targeted groups of voters 

    - India as a patronage democracy -> ethnic favouritism .
    
    - Brokers/ Intermediaries
    
      - *Naya Neta's* 
    
      - *You can’t buy a vote*

- Programmatic Voting

    - Voters reward performance on civic/economic and developmental issues.
    
    - Public provisioning of private, tangible goods 
    
    - Retrospective voting

        - Voters make the government accountable by punishing/rewarding them based on their actions during the rule. 
        
    - Perspective voting
    
        - Voters prefer a party based on their promises that will be delivered once they are in rule.


    
- Personalistic voting



---
    
- Partisanship

    - People identify with certain parties and their loyalty stays intact despite political circumstances. 
    

- Ideology

    - Spatial / Downsian model
    
         - preference based on ideological proximities between parties and voters ; Median voter theorem .
    
         - Ideology & Identity 



# Studying voting behaviour using surveys

---

- **Why use surveys? **

    - Is there utility beyond poll predictions? Use in academia, policy-making
    
    - Extensive thematic spread 
    
    - Consistency of questions gives temporal comparability 


- **Kinds of surveys **

  - Pre, Post and Exit 

- Clarifies issues salient to making voting decisions - short term and long term factors.

- Snapshot of group behaviour at macro level - group affiliation, groupthink, partisan sorting .
 


---

## National Election Studies 

- Conducted by the Lokniti-Centre for the Study of Developing Societies , NES are a series of nationally representative surveys conducted during before and after Lok Sabha elections.

- Consistent data on electoral choices available from 1996 onwards.

- Emphasis on random sampling, representativeness and vote integrity (through hidden ballot).

---

## National Election Studies 

**Studying voting behaviour involves going beyond the question of who people vote for. Major themes in the questionnaire :**

- Voting choice and partisan affiliation
- Issue and current events based voting
- Public opinion on institutions  
- Ideological position
- Religiosity
- Political participation and mobilisation
- Leadership effect 
- Demographic details 
- Media exposure

## Limitations of survey research

  - Biases associated with questionnaire design, sampling 
  
  - Sacrifice depth for scale 
  
  - Difficult to maintain comparability across waves 
  
  - Expensive 
  
  
  
---
  
## What does the future hold? 

  - Technological changes allows for greater frequency of large scale surveys.
  
  - Survey experiments
  
  - Longitudinal panel-based studies to understand nuanced changes in opinions.
  
  - More researchers with technical skills.

---

## Why is it difficult to study Indian voters ?

  
- Conceptual limitations: diverse country, post-colonial experiment, nascent democracy

- Data paucity: lack of longitudinal data, methodological concerns 

- False binary of methods : conversation between disciplines needs to move beyond simple criticism and towards greater synthesis and rigour 

- Lack of trained data researchers 

- Lack of open data access

## What do we know about Indian voters from surveys?


```{r image_1, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "47%",out.height= "47%", fig.align = "default"}

knitr::include_graphics(c("D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/1.png", "D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/2.png","D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/3.png","D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/4.png"))

```

```{r image_2, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "100%",out.height= "80%", fig.align = "default"}

## Future promises for electoral studies in India 


- Fill gaps in the data: Increasing ease of doing surveys allows for more data

- Indian voters not a mysterious entity! Possible to develop epistemology of Indian voters.

- Silent voters, swing voters, fluctuations, volatility - concepts developed elsewhere are even valid for the Indian context; only needs careful examination.

- Increasing media exposure, political churn and demographic changes are  producing new  political engagements.
