## Major theories of voting behaviour


- Sociological Model: Identified with the Columbia school - focuses on influence of social factors like group affiliation (**The People’s Choice; Personal Influence**).

- Psycho-social Model: Identified with the Michigan school - focuses on effect of partisanship or party identification (**The American Voter**).

- Rational Choice Model: Identified with the work by Anthony Downs (**An Economic Theory of Democracy**) and argues that voters seek to maximise the utility of their vote and parties seek to maximise electoral gains.



# How do Indians vote?

---


## Major theories and framework


###  Preferences and Political accountability

- Ethnicity, caste, religion

    - In-group favoritism - Ethnic voting

    - Co-religiosity and voting behaviour

- Clientelism/Patronage Politics:

    - Quid pro quo - Political parties earn support by the distribution of public or private goods to targeted groups of voters

    - India as a patronage democracy -> ethnic favouritism .

    - Brokers/ Intermediaries

      - *Naya Neta's*

      - *You can’t buy a vote*

---

- Programmatic Voting

    - Voters reward performance on civic/economic and developmental issues.

    - Public provisioning of private, tangible goods

    - Retrospective voting

        - Voters make the government accountable by punishing/rewarding them based on their actions during the rule.

    - Prospective voting

        - Voters prefer a party based on their promises that will be delivered once they are in rule.



- Personalistic voting



---

- Partisanship

    - People identify with certain parties and their loyalty stays intact despite political circumstances.


- Ideology

    - Spatial / Downsian model

         - Preference based on ideological proximities between parties and voters ; Median voter theorem .

         - Ideology & Identity



# Studying voting behaviour using surveys

---

- **Why use surveys? **

    - Is there utility beyond poll predictions? Use in academia, policy-making

    - Extensive thematic spread

    - Consistency of questions gives temporal comparability


- **Kinds of surveys **

  - Pre, Post and Exit

- Clarifies issues salient to making voting decisions - short term and long term factors.

- Snapshot of group behaviour at macro level - group affiliation, groupthink, partisan sorting .

## National Election Studies

- Conducted by the Lokniti-Centre for the Study of Developing Societies , NES are a series of nationally representative surveys conducted during before and after Lok Sabha elections.

- Consistent data on electoral choices available from 1996 onwards.

- Emphasis on random sampling, representativeness and vote integrity (through hidden ballot).

## National Election Studies

**Studying voting behaviour involves going beyond the question of who people vote for. Major themes in the questionnaire :**

- Voting choice and partisan affiliation
- Issue and current events based voting
- Public opinion on institutions
- Ideological position
- Religiosity
- Political participation and mobilisation
- Leadership effect
- Demographic details
- Media exposure





---





## Limitations of survey research

  - Biases associated with questionnaire design, sampling

  - Sacrifice depth for scale

  - Difficult to maintain comparability across waves

  - Expensive



---

## What does the future hold?

  - Technological changes allows for greater frequency of large scale surveys.

  - Survey experiments

  - Longitudinal panel-based studies to understand nuanced changes in opinions.

  - More researchers with technical skills.

---

## Why is it difficult to study Indian voters ?


- Conceptual limitations: diverse country, post-colonial experiment, nascent democracy

- Data paucity: lack of longitudinal data, methodological concerns

- False binary of methods : conversation between disciplines needs to move beyond simple criticism and towards greater synthesis and rigour

- Lack of trained data researchers

- Lack of open data access




# Way forward

## What do we know about Indian voters from surveys?


```{r image_1, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "47%",out.height= "47%", fig.align = "default"}

knitr::include_graphics(c("D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/1.png", "D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/2.png","D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/3.png","D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/4.png"))

```

knitr::include_graphics(c("D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/10.png", "D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/11.png","D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/12.png",
                          "D:/cpr/misc/books/indian_voter/13.png"))

```

## Future promises for electoral studies in India


- Fill gaps in the data: Increasing ease of doing surveys allows for more data

- Indian voters not a mysterious entity! Possible to develop epistemology of Indian voters.

- Silent voters, swing voters, fluctuations, volatility - concepts developed elsewhere are even valid for the Indian context; only needs careful examination.

- Increasing media exposure, political churn and demographic changes are  producing new  political engagements.
