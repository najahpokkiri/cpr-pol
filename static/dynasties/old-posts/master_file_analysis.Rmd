In this project we are using a novel dataset compiled by Rahul Verma. This dataset covers the candidates contested in the different levels of elections held from 1974 to 2019 in the state of Uttar Pradesh. This includes assembly, general and local body elections. This dataset connects the contestants to the political offices to their family members within that universe. 

  We define dynast politicians as those who are preceded by family members  who are currently active in politics or were active in the past. Family is defined as a set of individuals who are bound by proximate ties based on blood or marriage, and this definition includes father, mother, grand parents, siblings and in laws. Active in politics refers to holding an office in an elected body or being a candidate in elections. According to this definition, the head of family or the patriarch is considered to be a non-dynast in the year of entry. Precisely, because of the fact that he did not enjoy any advantage of having family members in politics at that point of time. But, ones a family member enter into the universe of politics, in later years patriarch will be considered as dynast along with the descendants.Additionally,  both the first and second member should be entered to the system through assembly or general elections 
  
  
  
  We have come up with different definitions for dynasties that are specific to this contest. They are as follows.



```{r }
knitr::include_graphics("D:/cpr/misc/dyn_def.jpeg")
```


For the purpose of this analysis we will be using the second definition.

## Summary statistics


**Entries from different levels**



### Local body


The  dynasty dataset includes winners from local body elections  for  all the local body institutions except GP - Block Panchayats, Zilla Panchayats , Nagar Panchayts and Nagar Nigams from the year 1995. 

```{r}
# 
# dyn %>% filter(election_type %!in% c("AE","GE")) %>% group_by(election_type) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% kable() %>%kable_styling(full_width = F)


```


| Urban/Rural      	| Local body            	| Observations 	|
|------------------	|-----------------------	|--------------	|
| Urban local body 	| Nagar Nigam           	| 60           	|

###  AE - GE 

This universe includes winners and runner-ups in the general and assembly elections from the year 1977 to 2019. 

- Total observations: `r dim(dyn_ae_ge)[1]`

- AE observations :`r (dim(dyn_ae_ge %>% filter(election_type=="AE") )[1])`

- AE unique observations :`r (dim(dyn_ae_ge %>% filter(election_type=="AE") %>% distinct(id))[1])`

- GE observations :`r (dim(dyn_ae_ge %>% filter(election_type=="GE"))[1])`

- GE unique observations :`r (dim(dyn_ae_ge %>% filter(election_type=="GE") %>% distinct(id))[1])`

- Number of unique individuals: `r dim(dyn_ae_ge_uniq_ind)[1]`

- Number of unique families : `r (dim(dyn_ae_ge_uniq %>% filter(dyn_tot_2==1))[1])`




The following section provides the year  and election level wise break-up  of the observations 

#### obs. break-up{.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}




##### Assembly Elections

```{r AE summary}

dyn %>% filter(election_type =="AE" ) %>% count(year) %>%  kable(col.names = c ("Year", "Count"))%>% kable_styling(full_width = F)

```

##### General Elections

```{r GE summary}
dyn %>% filter(election_type == "GE") %>% count(year) %>% kable(col.names = c ("Year", "Count"))%>%kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

### Levels

Families are spread at multiple office levels. While majority them are present only at the assembly election level, there are  a quite a few of them which is spanned across multiple level of office. The following table summarises that -


```{r}


dyn_ae_ge_uniq_fam %>% group_by(level) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% arrange(-count)%>% kable(caption = "Linkages of families(Category 2)")%>%kable_styling(full_width = F)

## AE GE election contest {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

 There could four types of election contests:

  - Dynast wins against against a Dynast
  - Dynast wins against a Non-dynast
  - Non-dynast wins against another Non-dynast
  - Non-dynast wins against a dynast

First table shows count of the contests and the second one shows the proportion of contests. First part represents the winner in both the tables headers.

## Life span

This section looks at the life span of families. Life span is calculated by computing the difference in entry year of the family with the last appearance of a member from the same family. Life span is simply the longitudinal life of a family. This  is calculated by simply computing the difference in the entry year of a family with the year in which the last member has contested. The following graph is a density chart of the the life span of the unique families in the dataset.


```{r}

dyn_ae_ge_fam <- dyn_ae_ge %>% filter(dyn_tot_2 ==1)


dyn_ae_ge_fam <- dyn_ae_ge_fam %>% group_by(family_id) %>% mutate(min_yr = min(year), max_yr = max(year))

## Land distribution {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

The dataset contains a variable named land which records the land owned by the candidate/family. The information is recorded in *bhigas*.

### Families

This boxplot shows the difference the land owned by family and  a non-family entity.

### Distribution - individuals


This tables shows the distribution of the unique individuals' experience/

```{r ae ge  breakup of experience catagories}
exp_cat_tab <- data.frame(table(dyn_ae_ge_uniq$fam_exp_cat))

catagories <- c("0", "1-5", "6-15", "16+")

```

### Distribution - family

This table shows the distribution of the experience categories among the families and non-families.

```{r ae ge  breakup of experience catagories - fam}
dyn_ae_ge_fam_exp <- dyn_ae_ge_uniq %>% group_by(dyn_tot_2, fam_exp_cat) %>% summarise(count =n()) %>% filter(!is.na(fam_exp_cat))

### caste

This shows the caste composition of the candidates with regards to their experience.
