In this post we analyse the performance of dynast MPs in their constituency by using a pan India survey conducted by Daksh and ADR on governance issues for the year 2013-14. The survey was conducted across 535 constituencies and it witnessed participation of 2.5 lakh+ voters. 

Apart from few questions survey was trying to measure two things. What are the constituents most pressing concerns and how well their representative perform in those areas. They are ranked from 1 to 3 where one means bad and three means good. Apart from that, they have also created a composite index of these two, which is rated out of 10.

The data we accessed has around 480 unique constituencies and we have been able to match ~405 constituencies from the survey data to our dynasty data. For all India analysis we are using the 2009 GE file where we have collected information regarding the dynast status from secondary resources. However, for the UP analysis we are using our own primary data.
